# Dictionary Builder

## TODO
- [x] Tests (front and back)
- [x] Prettier & Eslint
- [ ] Github hooks
- [x] Error handling
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Center .env (dev and prod)
- [ ] New UI*

I need to design the UI with a better understanding of how the user will use it.
As the backend is "done", then it is important to create a new UI that can be modular and easy to change.
